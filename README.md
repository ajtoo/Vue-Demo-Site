## For the Future

- pull the buttons out into their own components (and just generally do a better job with them)
- make better use of scoped CSS from the start (retroactive fix seems to have done an ok job, but I should have taken advantage from the start)
- improve how the content slider behaves when resized
- integrate bootstrap or other grid framework instead of using my own grid implementation
